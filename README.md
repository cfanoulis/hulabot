[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/0d155e63b147487a806432160120f207)](https://app.codacy.com/app/cfan/hulabot?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=cfanoulis/hulabot&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/cfanoulis/hulabot.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A Deep-Town Discord bot that likes to dance. A lot.

## What are we using
Our licence is MIT, because we use this awesome boiler plate called [GuideBot](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot).
All credit for anything that comes from that goes to @YorkAARGH. Everything else is homemade by me.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
You **MAY NOT** self-host this bot. Any self-hosted bot will be subject to copystricking, and would essentially need to be striped of functionality.
