A Deep-Town Discord bot that likes to dance. A lot.

## What are we using
Our licence is MIT, because we use this awesome boiler plate called [GuideBot](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot).
All credit for anything that comes from that goes to @YorkAARGH. Everything else is homemade by me.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
You **MAY NOT** self-host this bot. Any self-hosted bot will be subject to copystricking, and would essentially need to be striped of functionality.
