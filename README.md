A Deep-Town Discord bot that likes to dance. A lot.



## What are we using
Our licence is MIT, because we use this awesome boiler plate called [GuideBot](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/guidebot).
All credit for anything that comes from that goes to @YorkAARGH. Everything else is homemade by me.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
We ask that you do not self-host the bot. A lot of effort has been put in, and we do not want a gazillion of forks appearing.
